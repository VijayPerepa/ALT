Tasks to solve in this exercise
1. Open your workflow “Exercise_4”


2. Sales Data Input:
Input the 3 sales data files and use the UNION tool to union the data.


3. Converting Dates: 
Use the DateTime tool to convert the Date field using the appropriate format.
Afterwards run the workflow to see the results.
Hint: This will cause some conversion errros!

4. Converting Dates Trouble Shooting:
Use the Filter tool to filter the records that could not be converted (nulls).
Remember the different date format in these records!
You can verify your assumption on the date format by having a look at the initial 
Excel file (this is where some dates are in a different format).

5. Converting remaining Dates:
Use again the filter tool to create another additional column converting the dates 
with using the alternative date format.
Hint: You have to use a custom date!

6. Merge the two new date columns into one:
Use the Formula tool and an IF-statement to merge the two fields into a new 
complete data field.
Hint: Start the formula using IF [DateTime_Out] = Null() … (Syntax: IF c THEN t ELSE f ENDIF)

7. Unselect and rename fields and change data types:
Use the Select tool to unselect the three not necessary date fields and rename the last and 
correct date field to “Date”. Change the data type of that field to Date.

8. Use the Auto-Field tool:
Use the Auto-Field tool to make sure all fields are in the correct data type.

9. Join the two data streams using the Date & Store fields:
Use the Join Tool to join the data stream of the end of the Features data stream with 
the end of the sales_store data stream.

10. Save your workflow as “Exercise_5”
